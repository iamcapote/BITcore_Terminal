- **Fix Research Flow:** Addressed issues preventing the research command from executing correctly, including argument passing and recursive calls in `ResearchPath`.
- **Remove Local File Saving:** Modified `ResearchEngine` to generate markdown content in memory instead of saving to a local file.
- **Implement Post-Research Prompt (Web-CLI):**
    - Added `research_result_ready` WebSocket message.
    - Implemented server-side prompt context (`post_research_action`) in `routes.mjs`.
    - Added client-side handling in `terminal.js` to display the prompt.
    - Implemented action handling (`Download`, `Upload`, `Keep`) in `routes.mjs` based on prompt response.
    - Implemented client-side download trigger via `download_file` message.
    - Integrated GitHub upload functionality using `uploadToGitHub` utility.
- **Refined Input State Management:** Improved WebSocket input enable/disable logic using explicit server messages (`enable_input`, `disable_input`) and handler return values.
- **Improved Prompt Handling:** Added context to server-side prompts (`wsPrompt`) and client-side prompt handlers (`promptForInput`, `promptForPassword`). Handled prompt cancellation via Escape key.
- **Enhanced Logging:** Added more detailed logging throughout the WebSocket and command execution flow.
- **Session Management:** Added clearing of research results and other relevant data on logout, error, and session timeout. Added `session-expired` message.
