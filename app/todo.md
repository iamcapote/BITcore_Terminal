- [ ] **Storage Command (`/storage`):**
    - [ ] Implement `/storage save <filename.md>`: Takes the content stored in `session.currentResearchResult` and uploads it to GitHub using the configured settings and the provided filename. Requires login and potentially password for GitHub token.
    - [ ] Implement `/storage list`: Lists files in the configured GitHub repo's research directory (requires login/token).
    - [ ] Implement `/storage get <filename.md>`: Downloads a specific file from the GitHub repo (requires login/token).
    - [ ] Implement `/storage delete <filename.md>`: Deletes a specific file from the GitHub repo (requires login/token, potentially admin role).
- [ ] **Export Command (`/export`):**
    - [ ] Implement `/export`: Triggers a download of the content stored in `session.currentResearchResult` using the `download_file` WebSocket message.
- [ ] **Refine Error Handling:** Improve consistency and detail in error messages sent to the client.
- [ ] **Improve Progress Reporting:** Make progress updates more granular, especially during LLM calls and search result processing within `ResearchPath`.
- [ ] **CLI Mode Parity:** Ensure CLI mode (`executeResearch` without WebSocket) handles results appropriately (e.g., prints markdown to console).
- [ ] **Configuration Management:** Consider a more robust way to manage API keys and GitHub settings beyond simple environment variables or user prompts (e.g., encrypted config file).
- [ ] **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests for the research engine, command handlers, and WebSocket interactions.
- [ ] **Documentation:** Update README and command help text (`/help`) to reflect changes.
