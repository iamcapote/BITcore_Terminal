- [x] in "[research] Generating queries for:" we should be including both the original query and metadata from the ai token classifier. then use this to generate queries.
  - Implemented in research.path.mjs - Enhanced log message in research() method to include both original query and metadata
  - Added conditional logging: if metadata exists, it's included alongside the original query

- [x] In the back end is the file tree currently having the most optimmal structure and correct according to the differences vs features (client based) and infrastructure (server based). Most likely yes but ensure. also make sure that there are no duplicates etc.
  - Verified structure: The codebase follows a clear separation where `/features/` contains client-facing implementations and `/infrastructure/` contains server-side implementation with full features.
  - Found duplicate files with infrastructure versions having superior implementations:
  - `/app/features/research/research.engine.mjs` and `/app/infrastructure/research/research.engine.mjs`
  - `/app/features/research/research.path.mjs` and `/app/infrastructure/research/research.path.mjs`

  - Verified in infrastructure/research/research.path.mjs - line 42
  - Queries are properly truncated to 1000 characters before sending to search provider
  - Implementation: `const truncatedQuery = queryString.length > 1000 ? queryString.substring(0, 1000) : queryString;`
  - VALIDATED: Tested with validation script that confirms queries are correctly truncated
  - CONFIRMED: All query paths properly handle truncation including complex queries with metadata
