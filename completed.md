# MCP Application - Completed Tasks

This file logs tasks that have been completed during development.

*   Fixed `effectiveError is not a function` in `executeResearch` catch block by defining handlers outside the try block. (Done in previous step)
*   Fixed `cmdOutput is not a function` in `executeChat` for public users by ensuring handlers are passed correctly and adding validation. (Done in previous step)
*   Ensured public users cannot execute `/research` command by adding an early check in `executeResearch`. (Done in previous step)
*   Ensured public users receive the correct notice in `/chat` and are returned to command mode. (Done in previous step)
*   Ensured output/error handlers (`cmdOutput`, `cmdError`) are correctly passed from `handleCommandMessage` into the `options` object for `executeChat` and `executeResearch`. (Done in previous step)
*   Verified GitHub upload pipeline in `handleInputMessage`:
    *   Ensured `userManager.getGitHubConfig` is called with password. (Done in previous step)
    *   Ensured decrypted token is passed to `uploadToGitHub`. (Done in previous step)
    *   Added robust error handling for config retrieval and upload. (Done in previous step)
    *   Handled nested password prompt for GitHub token using `wsPrompt` context. (Done in previous step)
*   Ensured `promptData` (like `suggestedFilename`) is correctly set in `session.promptData` within `executeResearch` before prompting for post-research action. (Done in previous step)
*   Fixed routing logic in `ws.on('message')` to correctly pass in-chat commands starting with `/` to `handleChatMessage`. (Done in previous step)
*   Passed `output`/`error` handlers down to in-chat command executions (`exitMemory`, `executeResearch`, `executeExitResearch`) within `handleChatMessage`. (Done in previous step)
*   Passed `progressHandler` down to `executeResearch` and `executeExitResearch` when called from `handleChatMessage`. (Done in previous step)


- **Fix Research Flow:** Addressed issues preventing the research command from executing correctly, including argument passing and recursive calls in `ResearchPath`.
- **Remove Local File Saving:** Modified `ResearchEngine` to generate markdown content in memory instead of saving to a local file.
- **Implement Post-Research Prompt (Web-CLI):**
    - Added `research_result_ready` WebSocket message.
    - Implemented server-side prompt context (`post_research_action`) in `routes.mjs`.
    - Added client-side handling in `terminal.js` to display the prompt.
    - Implemented action handling (`Download`, `Upload`, `Keep`) in `routes.mjs` based on prompt response.
    - Implemented client-side download trigger via `download_file` message.
    - Integrated GitHub upload functionality using `uploadToGitHub` utility.
- **Refined Input State Management:** Improved WebSocket input enable/disable logic using explicit server messages (`enable_input`, `disable_input`) and handler return values.
- **Improved Prompt Handling:** Added context to server-side prompts (`wsPrompt`) and client-side prompt handlers (`promptForInput`, `promptForPassword`). Handled prompt cancellation via Escape key.
- **Enhanced Logging:** Added more detailed logging throughout the WebSocket and command execution flow.
- **Session Management:** Added clearing of research results and other relevant data on logout, error, and session timeout. Added `session-expired` message.
