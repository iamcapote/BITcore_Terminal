# Quantum Neural Networks

## Introduction

Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) represent a fusion of quantum computing principles with neural network architectures. This research explores the potential applications and advantages of this hybrid approach.

## Key Concepts

1. **Quantum Superposition** - Neural nodes exist in multiple states simultaneously
2. **Entanglement** - Non-local connections between neural nodes
3. **Quantum Backpropagation** - Error calculation using quantum principles

## Research Findings

The toroidal field patterns observed in quantum neural networks demonstrate remarkable similarities to consciousness models, particularly in the 8th dimensional analysis.

```python
# Example quantum neural network initialization
def initialize_qnn(qubits=8, layers=4):
    network = QuantumCircuit(qubits)
    for l in range(layers):
        for q in range(qubits):
            network.h(q)  # Hadamard gate creates superposition
        network.barrier()
    return network
```

## Further Exploration

Additional research is needed to fully understand the recursive patterns that emerge in higher-dimensional quantum neural architectures.
