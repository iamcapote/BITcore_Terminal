### Graduate School Entrance Exams
* The GRE General Test is an objective assessment of skills critical for success in graduate, business, and law programs worldwide.
* The GRE is required by most graduate schools in the United States and measures skills in math, reading, and writing.
* The GRE is considered the most widely used graduate exam and the most accurate test to gauge a student’s readiness for post-baccalaureate studies.

### Internet Speed Testing
* The Speedtest app is available for free on desktop and mobile devices and measures internet speed by testing the speed between the device and a test server using the device's internet connection.
* Different speed test apps may use different testing methodologies, which can result in variations in test results.
* Mbps (Megabits per second) is the main measure of an internet speed test, helping users determine if their internet speed is fast enough.
