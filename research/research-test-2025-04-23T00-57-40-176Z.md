## Summary

### Introduction to Testing
* The term "test" refers to a means of testing or assessing someone's knowledge or abilities.
* Tests can improve student recall and retention, and are considered a powerful means of improving learning, not just assessing it.
* The primary purpose of educational tests is to assess what students have learned after the completion of a lesson or unit.

### Educational Testing
* Educational tests serve the purpose of evaluating how much a student knows about a given subject and gauging their competence in particular concepts.
* Educational testing serves to evaluate how much a student knows about a given subject and measures skill levels.
* Accountability testing in education is carried out to hold schools, districts, and states accountable for student performance, with explicit performance standards and rewards for meeting them.
* Standardized tests are used to assess requirements for federal education funding and can provide an additional data point on student learning.
* Standardized tests offer an objective measurement of education and are used to measure academic aptitude and achievement.

### The GRE General Test
* The GRE General Test is an objective assessment of skills critical for success in graduate, business, and law programs worldwide.
* The GRE General Test assesses critical thinking abilities applicable in multiple disciplines.
* The test measures skills in three areas: Verbal Reasoning, Quantitative Reasoning, and Analytical Writing.
* Graduate schools use the GRE score, along with academic records and supporting materials, to assess readiness for graduate academic study.
* The GRE evaluates a student's readiness for advanced academic studies by assessing verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and analytical writing skills.

### Speedtest App
* The Speedtest app is available for free on desktop and mobile devices.
* Speedtest measures the speed between a device and a test server using the device's internet connection.
* The Speedtest app reports performance metrics, including throughput, which is the amount of data that can be transferred between two network endpoints over a given time interval.
* Speedtest has a global server network that allows for accurate internet speed tests anywhere.
* The Speedtest app calculates download and upload speeds by measuring the time it takes for the server to reply to a request from the user's client.

### Technical Details of Speedtest
* Speedtest.net operates mainly over TCP testing with a HTTP fallback for maximum compatibility and measures ping, download speed, and upload speed.
* The results are calculated by performing a series of downloads from and uploads to servers, such as Netflix servers, and calculating the maximum speed the Internet connection can provide.
* Ookla's Speedtest app offers reliable internet speed tests for free, providing bare-bones information to determine if users are getting the speed they're paying for.
* Speedtest uses an extensive server network, multiple testing points, consistent methodology, real-world testing conditions, and regular updates to provide accurate results.

### Conclusion
* Tests are an essential tool for assessing knowledge and abilities, and can improve student recall and retention.
* The GRE General Test is a widely used assessment for graduate school admissions, measuring critical thinking abilities in multiple disciplines.
* The Speedtest app provides a reliable and free way to measure internet speed, using a global server network and reporting performance metrics.
