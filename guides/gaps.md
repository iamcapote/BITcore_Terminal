use the #file:README.md and #file:current_app_folder_file_tree.md for application context found in the #folder:app . Once you have this context proceed to #file:gaps.md and #file:todo.md to implement the next stages of development starting with the easiest fixes. Once you have completed tasks you can move them into #file:completed.md but dont delete or omit anything as we want a full trail of all tasks.


our current web-cli app is not working and behaving properly search high and low in the #codebase to bring our app up to speed. check the #terminalLastCommand #terminalSelection #codebase to know how the app is behaving in console-cli and or web-cli depending on if its `npm start` for the web-cli or `npm start cli` for the console-cli.

you are a well respected and excellent developer with decades of experience shipping full live products that bring in thousands of users and a lot of revenue. if you modify any file make sure you understand its contents and context first and you arent deleting anything important this is a very serious app and it is live.


# Platform Gap Snapshot (2025-10-01)

_All tests run with `npm test` on 2025-10-01._

## üö® Critical blockers
- **Broken research provider shim** ‚Äî `app/features/ai/research.providers.mjs` still contains placeholder text (`// ...existing code...`) and malformed exports. Import analysis fails, taking down `/chat`, `/research`, and every suite that touches the provider.
  - Evidence: `npm test` ‚Üí `vite:import-analysis` error across `tests/chat.test.mjs`, `tests/cli-integration.test.mjs`, `tests/chat-persona.cli.test.mjs`, and `app/tests/provider.test.mjs`.
  - Next move: Replace the shim with the thin re-export to `research.providers.service.mjs` (or update callers to the new modules) before shipping anything else.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è High-priority follow-ups
- **Multi-user CLI roadmap** ‚Äî `/users` now reports "User management is disabled in single-user mode" unless a directory adapter is registered via `userManager.registerUserDirectoryAdapter`. Provide a reference adapter once multi-user access control returns to the roadmap.
- **Legacy HTTP research endpoint** ‚Äî `app/features/research/routes.mjs` still answers `POST /api/research` with `501` and logs a security warning. No auth/validation exists.
  - Action: Either finish the authenticated handler or remove the route to avoid false promises.
- **Web research/session telemetry coupling** ‚Äî WebSocket connection bootstraps GitHub activity streams and status snapshots by default (`features/research/websocket/connection.mjs`). Works in single-user mode but still lacks multi-user hardening (durable session store, prompt password resets).
  - Action: Monitor after the provider fix and schedule a resilience review when multi-user support becomes a requirement.
- **Plaintext credentials** ‚Äî `global-user.json` now stores Brave, Venice, and GitHub tokens unencrypted. This keeps the CLI simple but regresses the previous AES-GCM protection.
  - Action: Gate production builds behind an encryption toggle or re-enable the vault once the research blocker clears.

## üìä QA + Ops snapshot
- `npm test`: 48 suites pass, 5 fail (all caused by the provider shim parse error). Rerun after the critical fix lands.
- `tests/github-memory.test.mjs`: Emits ‚Äúfatal: not a git repository‚Äù warnings because it exercises fallback persistence without a real repo. Acceptable for now but document if the noise becomes problematic.
- Manual `/users list`: emits "User management is disabled in single-user mode" until multi-user storage returns.
- Manual `/keys test`: succeeds when keys are present in `global-user.json`; no password prompts occur in single-user mode.

## üß≠ Next recommended actions
1. Ship the `research.providers.mjs` repair and rerun the full test suite.
2. Decide the fate of the HTTP `/api/research` endpoint (secure & implement vs. decommission).
3. Reconcile `/users` command behaviour with the new single-user contract (graceful message + documentation update).
4. Schedule a pass on WebSocket session persistence and credential storage once multi-user support is back in scope.
